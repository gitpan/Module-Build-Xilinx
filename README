Module::Build::Xilinx is a perl module to generate a Tcl script to create, build
and program a Xilinx FPGA development board using Xilinx ISE Webpack. It
generates a Tcl script that you can use with Xilinx's xtclsh interpreter to
perform all required tasks.

To install do the following:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build test
    $ ./Build install

Xilinx ISE is only supported on Windows and Linux, hence we only support this
module on Windows and Linux. Technically this module can work on other OSes as
well because all it does is code generation.
